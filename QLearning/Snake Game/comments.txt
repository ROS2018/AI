Note:
* Better to take reward = 0 instaed of 1 when the snake get in empty block (no collision, no fruit), otherwise the snake will learn to turn in circle to maximise reward.
* Try to increase the likehood for the eploration during last steps
* Try to avoid exploring actions, already have been explored
* The network train a lot on the first steps, while it learn little on the last steps, that's probably why snake
    stack in local minima and cannot discover new better states (i.e needs trimendous of time to learn about the advanced steps),
     try to fix that.
**** Try to maintain the game in each state until the snake learn better and take the best action for that state. (maintain the apple
untile the snake learn how to munch it)
